This project is written in RUST, a systems programming language persuing fearless concurrency, memory saftey, and speed. Essentially, it's my favorite language because it's heck'n awesome but also quite complicated with a very strong type system.

Anyways, you can run it by typing

```rust
cargo run [--release]
```

## MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE ROOT DIR OF THE PROJECT

Cargo is a package manager provided by the rust developers that controls pretty much everything.
