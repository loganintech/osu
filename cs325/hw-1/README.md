# Running

You can run all of these programs by running `./test.sh`

Alternatively, you could run each with `python3 script_name.py`

Ensure `data.txt` is in the same folder as the python scripts. I've included a sample `data.txt` for you. The script expects a space-sepparated list of numbers that ends in a linesepparator.
