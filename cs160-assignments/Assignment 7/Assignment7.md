# Assignment 7 More Loops and Functions
## Problem Analysis

* I need to know what 6 letters I want to print
* I need to know which of the letters are supported in my program
* I need to know what the user wants to print

* Literally all I need are if statements, for/while loops, and input()

## Program Design

* Functions to print a letter to the screen
    * Pre: The letter
    * Post: Assemble the printing
    * Return: The lines that make up the letter

* Functions to get user string
    * Pre: Nothing, perhaps preset string?
    * Post: Have a string that we want to print and is supported
    * Return: The string IE "sierrraacciice"

* Function to pick which letter to print
    * Pre: The letter we want to print
    * Post: Running the letter function associated with the letter provided in pre OR post that something went wrong
    * Return: The letter's lines

* Main Loop
	* Pre: Perhaps nothing, maybe a command line string that is supported
	* Post: Print out the letters, ask if you want to continue?
	* Return: Nothing
