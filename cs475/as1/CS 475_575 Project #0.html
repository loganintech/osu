        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
                A great use for parallel programming is identical operations on large arrays of numbers.


        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <ol>

                <p>
                </p>
                <li>
                        Pick an array size to do the arithmetic on.
                        Something like 16384 (16K) will do.
                        Don't pick something too huge, as your machine may not allow you to use that much memory.
                        Don't pick something too small, as the overhead of using threading might dominate the
                        parallelism gains.

                        <p>
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Using OpenMP, pairwise multiply two large floating-point arrays, putting the results in another
                        array.
                        Do this in a for-loop.
                        <br>
                        <tt>C[ i ] = A[ i ] * B[ i ];</tt>

                        <p>
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Do this for one thread and do this for four threads:
                        <br>
                        #define NUMT 1
                        <br>
                        and
                        <br>
                        #define NUMT 4


                        <p>
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Time the two runs.
                        Convert the timing results into "Mega-Multiplies per Second".

                        <p>
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        What speedup, S, are you seeing when you move from 1 thread to 4 threads?
                        <br>
                        <font size="+2"><b>S</b></font> = (Execution time with one thread) / (Execution time with four
                        threads)
                        = (Performance with for threads) / (Performance with one thread)
                        <br>
                        This number shoud be greater than 1.0 .
                        If not, be sure you are using the correct numerator and denominator.


                        <p>
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        If your 1-thread-to-4-threads speedup is
                        <font size="+2"><b>S</b></font>,
                        compute the parallel fraction:
                        <tt>
                                <pre>float Fp = (4./3.)*( 1. - (1./S) );
</pre></tt>
                        Don't worry what this means just yet.
                        This will become more meaningful soon.
                        <br>
                        You must have used 1-thread-to-4-threads.
                        The numbers in this equation depend on that.

                        <p>
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Your written commentary (turned in as a PDF file) should include:
                        <ol>
                                <li>Tell what machine you ran this on
                                </li>
                                <li>What performance results did you get?
                                </li>
                                <li>What was your 4-thread-to-one-thread speedup?
                                </li>
                                <li>If the 4-thread-to-one-thread speedup is less than 4.0, why do you think it is this
                                        way?
                                </li>
                                <li>What was your Parallel Fraction, Fp?
                                </li>
                        </ol>
