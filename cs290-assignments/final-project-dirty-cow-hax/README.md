## What it Does
* Displays a main page with all of the users.
* Capability to create a user.
* Each user has their own page with their recent entries and a graph of all of their entries over time.
* User can Update and Remove entries from their page.
* Cabability to remove user (?).

## VSCode
* I have setup the workspace so that if you use VSCode, you will have debugging support
* To follow the tiny bit of style, make sure you have `EditorConfig.editorconfig`
* You may also want `msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome` or `hbenl.vscode-firefox-debug`
* By default, I'll set it up for firefox (since I use it)
