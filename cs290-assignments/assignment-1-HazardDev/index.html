				<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
				<p>
					This was the intro assigment for the CS290 class. In this assignment, I had to make a basic website with a bit of information
					about myself. I had to include a nicely structured page with headings, a list thrown in there, and an image. I decided
					to put my name in H1 for viewability and a link to this blog in H2. I then had the questions answered one by one within
					an unordered list's list items. Unfortunately, I already have all the knowledge required to complete this assignment.
					I say unfortunately because I am looking forward to learning in this class. Please understand, I'm not harping on the
					assignment itself. I'm very much looking forward to the future assignments in this class. As the previous bullet points
					suggest, I didn't need any outside resources (articles, piazza, youtube, etc) to complete this assignment.

				<h3>
					Assignment 2
				</h3>
				<p>
					In this assignment, I had to style a web page to match a mockup as close as possible. I found that this was not a particularly
					difficult thing to do, as I have done work like this many times before. I will admit, I did have to do a quick google
					of CSS Flex Boxes, as it was having weird behavior with
					<code>inline-flex</code> but I figured it out rather quick. The entire assignment took about an hour to finish. I don't think that it was all
					that difficult for me. I am excited to see what becomes of this class, though. It should be interesting.

				<h3>
					Assignment 3
				</h3>
				<p>
					In this assignment, I had to write javascript that would dynamically add and remove from the DOM in various locations. I
					don't think my javascript was challenged too much here, except for possibly the re-adding
					<i>in order</i> which was a bit difficult. However, this overall wasn't too much of a challenge. I also learned about parent.insertBefore
					and parent.appendChild, which both were incredibly useful when manipulating the DOM. There wasn't much that was
					<i>too</i> difficult overall. Adding in order was definitly the most challenging aspect of this.

				<h3>Assignment 4</h3>
				<p>
					I hate to be a broken record, but I didn't have any big issues with this assignment either. Any problems I had were solved
					with prior knowledge. I did learn more about the way the filesystem module loads files into a
					<code>Buffer</code> object, and how the http module works a bit. I used mostly just the NodeJS Documentation for Filesystem, Buffer, and
					http. I did google whether or not you could store raw buffer objects in an object. It's nice to know you can, easily.

				<h3>Assignment 5</h3>
				<p>
					I did have some more difficulty with this assignment. General templating was familiar to me, as I've had plenty of work with
					AngularJS and AngularTS. However, the way to actually render the information was confusing, at first. I didn't realize
					that the node actually renders with the information, I thought it was client side. Then once I figured that out, I couldn't
					figure out how to render the pre-compiled template. I'll admit, it was the due date (the 27th) when someone in class
					helped me figure that out. After that, it was very simple. I don't think adding or using express itself is all that
					difficult, as I've done it plenty of times before. I did have to google client-side handlebars templating and general
					template heirarchy rules, as well as the partials directory config.
