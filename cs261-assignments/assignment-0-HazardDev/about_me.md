* I am a computer science major and newly a sophomore.
* I have signed up for piazza.
* I wrote a program for my keyboards that would color the lettering (it's rgb) based off of what happens in certain video games. As a result, the manufacturer of the company flew me out to PAX West Seattle to help run their booth in Summer 2016. I helped make sure the program ran smoothly as the person I wrote it with was from the netherlands and could not make the trip out. It was an awesome experience and part of why I love being a programmer.
