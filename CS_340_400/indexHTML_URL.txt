The index page shows all movies in our DB with the ability to add movies to the list, update the information for a movie in the table, and delete a movie.

The other pages will show the contents of their respective tables, showings, Tickets, Theatres, Rooms, and Customers. Each will provide similar functionality as the Movie table has through index.html.
